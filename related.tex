\section{Comparison with \OldBackpack{}}

The inspiration for this
work was the original Backpack paper~\cite{backpack}.  Backpack was
first to pose the problem of retrofitting Haskell with interfaces, and
many of its design ideas, such as mixin packages, applicativity and
module identities have been preserved in this paper.  The primary contribution
of this paper is an actual \emph{implementation} of the
Backpack design, by refactoring of these ideas into a form that can be
implemented in two stages: mixin linking handled by the package manager,
and typechecking and compilation handled by the compiler.  However,
there are also some other points where \Backpack{} diverges from
\OldBackpack{}, which we elaborate on below.

\paragraph{No shaping pre-pass}

Because \Backpack{} does not support mutual recursion, it is not
necessary to perform a shaping pass to precompute the identities of all
of the exports in a library.  \Backpack{} \emph{does} have a miniature
shaping step, which occurs during signature merging when we merge export
lists (\textsc{MExport} in \cref{typing:merging}), which
produces a names substitution (the ``shape''); unlike \OldBackpack{},
however, we can perform this
shaping process incrementally.  This is good from an implementation
perspective, since it reduces the amount of work which needs to be done
when we recompile: a pre-pass would require us to shape all of the modules
in a package before doing any work.

\paragraph{Unordered syntax}

\Backpack{}, unlike most existing module systems (including \OldBackpack{}
and most ML variants) has an \emph{unordered} module language.  This was
motivated by the existing Cabal package language, which was unordered.

When designing an unordered language, we must design our semantics so
that there is only one behavior which makes sense under any ordering.
One way to solve this problem is to precompute type information
(as in \OldBackpack{}) before typechecking proper.  However, as we've mentioned previously,
\Backpack{} does \emph{not} do a pre-pass in the interest of
separate compilation.  Fortunately, the absence of recursive modules
allows us to avoid addressing the issue in some cases: since it is not possible
for a \Backpack{} signature to import a module that transitively
depends on the very same signature, we don't have to say whether or not
a signature is typechecked before or after the inherited signatures from
dependencies are added to the context.

Being unordered takes away some expressivity from \Backpack{}: for example, module
signatures (\verb|hsig| files) no longer subsume \verb|hs-boot| files
(GHC's current mechanism for supporting mutually recursive modules).
Within an unordered package, there is no way to tell if \verb|import A|
was intended to refer to a signature or a module.  (\verb|hs-boot| files
do not have this problem, as imports to the \verb|hs-boot| file are
explicitly disambiguated using a \verb|{-# SOURCE #-}| pragma).

\paragraph{Per-package modularity}

In \OldBackpack{}, type equality was based on a per-module computed
\emph{module identity}.  In effect, every defined module separately kept
track of the set of signatures that it transitively imported.
\Backpack{} posed the design constraint that mixin linking should not
inspect source code. Thus, \Backpack{} needs a coarser notion of
identity. In \Backpack{}, \emph{\uid{}s} record \emph{all} of the
requirements in the component, so that every module in a component
depends on the choice of implementation for every signature in the
component.  This can be inconvenient at times, as it means that if you
want a module to depend on fewer signatures, you must move it to a
separate package, but this restriction allows us to preserve the
abstraction barrier between the package manager and compiler.

\paragraph{Type classes}

While \OldBackpack{} did not tackle the problem of type classes in their
formalized work, they suggested that type classes could be handled
\emph{soundly} by introducing the capability of explicitly naming instances
in the intermediate language.  They were specifically concerned with the
following case:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}
    A :: [ data T ]
    B = [ import A; instance Eq T ]
    A = [ data T = MkT; instance Eq T where ... ]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Without the ability to hide A's declaration of an \verb|Eq| instance
from \verb|B|, \verb|B| would fail to typecheck due to a duplicate
instance declaration.

As we observed in \cref{sec:metatheory}, while such instance
hiding would work for ordinary type class instances, it would not work
for associated types, as type equality axioms cannot be hidden in any
meaningful way.  Furthermore, Haskell users generally expect there
to be only one instance of a type class for a type \emph{globally} (for
example, data types like \verb|Map| and \verb|Set| rely on being used
with only one \verb|Ord| instance; if this is not the case, internal
invariants in the data type may be broken).

Thus motivated, \Backpack{} takes a different approach of not hiding
instances at all.  This is an ``unsound'' (in the sense that typechecking
against a signature does not guarantee that you will link successfully
with the module) but practical solution to the type classes problem
and does not seem to cause issues in practice.

\section{Comparison with MixML}

Many of the original points of comparison between \OldBackpack{} and
MixML still hold for \Backpack{}: like \OldBackpack{}, we do not support
first-class or higher-order units, nor do we support hierarchical
modules (Haskell's ``hierarchical'' module namespace is merely a method
for organizing a flat namespace of module names) or translucent sealing
(one of the defining characteristics of ML module systems).

One new point of comparison between \Backpack{} and MixML is \emph{type lookup}
in the presence of transparent type synonyms (which were not supported
by \OldBackpack{}).  In MixML, the combination of transparent type
synonyms and mixin linking necessitates the use of \emph{bidirectional lookup}, where
type lookup of abstract types is performed in both directions simultaneously.
Here is the bidirectional lookup example from MixML, transcribed to Haskell:

\begin{tabular}{p{0.30\textwidth} p{0.30\textwidth} p{0.30\textwidth}}
\begin{verbatim}
signature A where
    type T = Int
    data U
    f :: Int -> U
\end{verbatim}
&
\begin{verbatim}
signature A where
    data T
    type U = Bool
    f :: T -> Bool
\end{verbatim}
&
\begin{verbatim}
signature A where
    type T = Int
    type U = Bool
    f :: Int -> U
\end{verbatim}
\end{tabular}
%
MixML operates by typechecking the first signature, then performing
a \emph{type computation} on the second signature (determining its types
but not type checking its functions), and then backpatching
the types from the second to the first before properly typechecking
the second signature and merging them together.

Because \Backpack{} does not have to deal with the double vision problem
(because it lacks mutual recursion), a simpler strategy suffices: we can
assume that each signature has already been typechecked, pick the most
defined types and then check for compatibility.

%   This would resolve
%   the MixML issue above, since we would now be obligated to propagate
%   knowledge that \verb|type t = int| no matter where that declaration
%   occurred in the program.  

%   As \Backpack{} supports type synonyms where \OldBackpack{} did not,
%   it is instructive to do a detailed comparison of how \Backpack{} handles
%   many of the problems associated with transparent type declaration
%   which \OldBackpack{} sidesteps by only considering the \emph{names}
%   of language entities (rather than their computed types).

%   It's worth recapping what has \emph{not} changed since \OldBackpack{}.
%   As before, \Backpack{} does not attempt to implement all of the features
%   of ML module systems.  We do not support first-class and higher order
%   units; indeed, from an implementation perspective, it is difficult to
%   see how these features would be implemented without compromising on
%   \Backpack{}'s promise that programming with signatures will be no less
%   efficient than programming against the implementing module directly.
%   Similarly, we do not support hierarchical linking or translucent
%   sealing.

%   Compare
%   to MixML, where the ordering of linking matters, even in the absence
%   of binding constructs:

%   \begin{figure}[H]
%   \begin{tabular}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
%   \begin{lstlisting}[language=ML,escapechar=@]
%   (* REJECTED by paper MixML *)
%   { type t,
%     val f : t -> t,
%     val x = f 2 }
%   with
%   { type t = int }
%   \end{lstlisting}
%   &
%   \begin{lstlisting}[language=ML]
%   (* ACCEPTED by paper MixML *)
%   { type t = int }
%   with
%   { type t,
%     val f : t -> t,
%     val x = f 2 }
%   \end{lstlisting}
%   \end{tabular}
%   \caption{Order matters in MixML\@.  Note that mixml 0.2.1 accepts both programs, as it has a more general template pass which differs from the journal version of MixML.}
%   \label{fig:order-matters-in-mixml}
%   \end{figure}

%   In the first example, the first module is typechecked without knowledge
%   that \verb|type t = int|, and so the application \verb|f 2| fails to
%   typecheck.  In the second example, the results of bidirectional type
%   lookup are applied to \verb|t| before the module is typechecked,
%   causing us to accept the module.

\section{Modularity in the package manager}

While there is far more
literature on module systems that can be implemented entirely by a
compiler, there has been some work which has looked at the problem of
modular development at the package level.

One such system
is the Functoria DSL\footnote{\smaller\url{https://mirage.io/blog/introducing-functoria}}
of MirageOS~\cite{mirageos}.  MirageOS is a library operating system
written in OCaml, which provides modules and functors for constructing
unikernels.  Rather than manually instantiate these functors,
users write in the Functoria DSL, which describes what
dependencies to install (via the OCaml package manager) and how the ML
functors should be assembled.  Unlike \Backpack{}, their DSL follows
the model of explicit functor applications rather than mixin linking.

The Nix package manager~\cite{dolstra:thesis} is a
system for enabling reproducible builds of packages. Nix defines a (pure, functional) language of component
\emph{derivations}---\ie{} the source code and configuration
needed to build the derived component---%
functorized over configuration parameters and derivations of
depended-upon components.  Components are linked together with explicit
functor application, albeit with some of the syntactic convenience of
mixin linking.  However, there is no type system for components,
and thus the Nix output hashes (similar to our \cid{}s) only serve
the role of uniquely identifying derivations.

The SMLSC extension to Standard ML~\cite{swasey+:smlsc}, while
primarily intended as a mechanism to support separate compilation in
Standard ML, also has some similarities to \Backpack{}.  Like
Backpack, SMLSC operates at the level of \emph{units} (our
components), and defines interfaces between units to allow them to be
separately typechecked.  Unlike \Backpack{}, SMLSC does not support
reusing units with different
implementations of their interfaces: dependencies in SMLSC are always
\emph{definite references}, and signatures are used purely to permit
separate compilation.  In SMLSC, if you want multiple instantiations,
you are expected to use ML functors.

An unusual case of \emph{not} using a package manager when it would be
useful occurs in C++ templates.\footnote{\smaller%
  \url{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Template-Instantiation.html}}
C++ templates are
applicative, in the sense that two occurrences of \verb|vector<int>| refer to the
same type.  However, the C++ compiler must generate code when a
template is instantiated. Implemented naively, this could result in a
lot of duplicate copies of code.  One early method of handling this
problem, ``Cfront model'', involved a template database where
instances of templates were maintained.  However, it was too
complicated for most C++ compilers to handle this database, and so the
usual ``Borland model'' (implemented by GCC, among others) is to just
recompile every template instantiation and deduplicate them at link
time.  With Backpack, we already have a package manager, Cabal, which
administers its own installed package database, so we can offload the
caching of instantiated components to it.  (This technique would not
work for C++ templates, whose type based dispatch must be deeply
integrated with the compiler.)

\section{ML functors}

The original Backpack language distinguished
itself from ``functors'' in (variants of) the ML module system
\cite{milner+:def-of-sml-revised,ocaml} by the fact that it supported
separate type checking for recursive modules under applicative
instantiation.  Additionally, by being a mixin system, it is a
better fit for the package language and avoids the need for
sharing constraints.

As this paper does not address mutual recursion, one may wonder
if the \unit{} language is not simply just a stylized applicative
functor language. In fact, it is!  The reason our technical presentation
is done in the way it is done here is because our primary goal
was integrating with the existing compiler infrastructure.

\section{Mixin linking}

There is a rich literature in the mixin
linking world, which both Backpack and \Backpack{} draw heavily from
\cite{ancona+:cms,flatt+:units,rossberg+:mixml}.  Indeed,
the relationship to this literature is even clearer in \Backpack{}, as
the mixin linking step is factored out and is independent of the
Haskell language.  For example, the basic algorithm for linking in
Cardelli's \emph{linksets} calculus~\cite{cardelli:linksets}, at a
high level, is essentially the same algorithm as our mixin linking.
The difference, however, is that we must keep track of the structure
of the ``wiring diagram'', as this structure will be used to establish
the identities of types at the Haskell level.  In contrast, Cardelli
gave no account of the interaction between module-level linking and
core-level user-defined abstract data types.

The object oriented community has also studied mixin-style composition
in their designs.  However, these mechanisms are organized around
dynamic binding and objects; whereas in Backpack-style systems,
the emphasis is on packages.  Users of \Backpack{} pay no performance
penalty switching from a direct dependency to an indirect dependency
via a signature, because we don't do separate compilation of \Backpack{}.
